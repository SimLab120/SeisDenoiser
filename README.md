# Seismic Data Denoising Using Vision Transformer

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a seismic data denoising technique using a **Vision Transformer (ViT)**. It leverages **machine learning** and **deep learning** frameworks to effectively remove noise from seismic signals, improving data quality for further geophysical analysis.

## Features
- Utilizes **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for seismic data denoising.
- Supports **GPU acceleration** for faster training and inference.
- Implements **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques using TensorFlow.
- Includes **visualization tools** for assessing denoising performance.
- Supports **data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and model saving/loading**.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:

- Python (>= 3.7)
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pickle

Install the required dependencies using:

```sh
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn numpy matplotlib pickle


## GPU Support
This notebook is optimized for **GPU usage**. Ensure you have the proper **CUDA** and **cuDNN** versions installed along with TensorFlow to utilize **GPU acceleration**.

## Usage
### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/seismic-denoising-vit.git
cd seismic-denoising-vit
